# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game developed as a Windows Forms application. The game consists of two forms: a main menu and the game interface.
Players can select the number of rounds they want to play before starting the game. Once the rounds are completed, the game determines the winner. Additionally, there is an optional endless mode that allows players to continue playing beyond the selected rounds.
